- Black keys are fifths, like Nopia (double check how that was presented)
     - Chord being played is displayed in plugin
     - Notes making up the chord being played are displayed
     - Dissonance level is shown (based on tonic, subdominant, or dominant)
     - Recommended next chords (based on connections) are shown, along with the key on the keyboard to use for that chord

TODO: Ideas from Bryce
If we can read the length and position in the clip (timing), 
     - Suggest passing notes or embelishments
     - For current chord, other chords it could be replaced with
     - For current chord, other chords that could come after
     - Like MS Word Clippy for music - "Hey! I noticed this chord sounds like shit. Have you considered this one?"

     - Filter chords by instrument! Guitar chords vs piano chords (range is bigger on piano than guitar) vs bass arpeggios
